# Squid examples

Repository of examples integrating the Squid API, SDK and Widget âœ¨ðŸ’œ

## Instructions

Requires `node` and `npm` to be installed

Navigate to the folder you want to try
`cd V2/api/evmToEVMSwap`

Install packages
`yarn install`

Copy the .env.example to a file named .env in the same directory, fill in your values. These will not be committed, since .env is in the .gitignore file.

Run index.js
`yarn start`

## How to approach this

Get straight into code! Run the route example of your choice, understand it, and then start extending. Send some tokens to the Cosmos, buy an NFT across chains, and stake across chains.

Check out our [docs](https://docs.squidrouter.com) for a deeper look, and some hidden features.
